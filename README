A collection of the tests that you want to run when getting know to the Telegram Bot API.

To create your bot please talk to the BotFather bot in your Telegram app. As soon as you have a token, modify the corresponding places in code like the one in the Bot.pm file marked with capital letters: YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE.

The .psgi set of files are the second part of the examples, which require a PSGI server running on your web server. Please make sure you have a valid  SSL certificate at your machine (otherwise Telegram will not send a word to your webhook). Also, modify the URL in the file setting a webhook URL (04_webhook.pl).

Would you have any thoughts you'd like to share with me, feel free to contact me.
